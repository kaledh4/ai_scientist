# AI Timelines & Opportunities

This project is an interactive educational tool designed to help users explore the future of artificial intelligence. It is composed of three distinct pages, each focusing on a different aspect of AI's potential development.

## Pages

### 1. AI Timelines & Opportunities (`index.html`)

This is the main page of the project. It provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize and play with a story about the future of AI. Users can manipulate a timeline to see how AI capabilities might evolve and how different events could impact the future.

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand the concept of AI timelines.
- Explore the potential for exponential growth in AI capabilities.
- See how different factors could influence the future of AI.

### 2. Geopolitical Race (`geopolitical-race.html`)

This page focuses on the geopolitical dynamics of the AI arms race, specifically between the US and China. It features an interactive calculator that lets users explore how factors like compute share and algorithmic progress can affect the balance of power.

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand the key factors in the AI arms race.
- Explore the current geopolitical landscape of AI development.
- See how different scenarios could play out in the US-China AI competition.

### 3. FLOPS Calculator (`flops-calculator.html`)

This page provides a tool for estimating when AI might match or exceed human research capacity. Users can input their own predictions for factors like FLOPS growth, AI efficiency, and compute budget to see how these variables affect the timeline for AI development.

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand the concept of FLOPS and its importance in AI.
- Learn how to estimate AI timelines based on key metrics.
- Explore the potential for AI to automate scientific research.

## How to Use

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to get started. From there, you can navigate to the other pages to explore the different aspects of the AI forecast.
