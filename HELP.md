# How to View Debugging Messages

If you are still experiencing issues with the interactive elements of this site, you can help me diagnose the problem by opening your browser's developer console and looking for error messages or the debugging messages I've added.

Here are simple instructions for how to open the developer console in most popular web browsers.

## Google Chrome

1.  **Right-click** anywhere on the page and select **"Inspect"** from the menu.
2.  A new panel will open. At the top of this panel, click on the **"Console"** tab.
3.  You should see any error messages or debugging logs here.

**Shortcut:** `Ctrl+Shift+J` (on Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (on Mac).

## Mozilla Firefox

1.  **Right-click** anywhere on the page and select **"Inspect"** or **"Inspect Element"** from the menu.
2.  A new panel will open. At the top of this panel, click on the **"Console"** tab.
3.  You should see any error messages or debugging logs here.

**Shortcut:** `Ctrl+Shift+J` (on Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (on Mac).

## Microsoft Edge

1.  **Right-click** anywhere on the page and select **"Inspect"** from the menu.
2.  A new panel will open. At the top of this panel, click on the **"Console"** tab.
3.  You should see any error messages or debugging logs here.

**Shortcut:** `Ctrl+Shift+J` (on Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (on Mac).

## What to Look For

When you perform an action on the page (like moving a slider), you should see messages appearing in the console that start with "Updating dashboard...", "Calculating crossover date...", etc.

If you see any messages in **red**, these are likely errors. Please copy and paste any error messages you see, along with a description of what you were doing when the error occurred. This information will be extremely helpful for me to finally resolve the issue.

Thank you for your help!
